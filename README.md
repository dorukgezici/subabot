_An AI-powered Slack alert bot to subscribe, classify and notify for keywords on RSS feeds._

## ðŸš€ Get Started

Subabot runs on [Deta Space](https://deta.space), a new personal Cloud. After you sign up, you get your own instance of Subabot, it is completely isolated from other users and we can't access it.

You can think of it like installing an app on your phone, but instead of the app being on your phone, it exists on the internet for you to access from all of your devices. You remain in control of your apps and your data.

After you sign up for [Deta Space](https://deta.space), install the [Subabot App](https://deta.space/discovery/subabot) and you are good to go ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ”¨ Features & Roadmap

- [x] Crawl RSS feeds for keywords
- [x] Alert Slack when new matches are found
- [ ] Classify matches using OpenAI
